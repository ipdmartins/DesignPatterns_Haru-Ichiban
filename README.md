	This repo is about university work, more specifically on the subject of Desing Patterns. The aim was to implement patterns by developing a board game called Haru-Ichiban. This game has two gardeners with eight flowers each. Their goal is to position their flowers in some specific way. Each way has its level of difficulty and brings a score to the garden.

	Design Patterns belong to the best practices to be used by developers in object-oriented programming. Programmers, considering their experiences over time, built some concepts to solve common problems related to software development. They serve to avoid repetitive coding and to reuse implementations in distinct parts of your code, for example. Commonly, they are classified in creational, structural, and behavioral. Some of the patterns implemented in this code are the Factory, Singleton, Builder, Prototype, Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Observer, State, Strategy, and MVC.
